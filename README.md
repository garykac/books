# Books

A collection of short, chapter-by-chapter book summaries for ongoing book series that I'm in the middle of. These are so that I can quickly "re-read" the previous volumes when a new one is released.

These summaries assume that you're read the original works and are just refreshing your memory. There will probably be parts that don't make sense if you haven't.
